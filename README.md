# Max-Flame-intensity
This repository was used to measure the brightest location in a diffusion flame. The image is calibrated using two lasers located 80 mm apart. Temperature measurements are taken separately.

The main file is "Temperature_Measurement.m". All the user needs to do is specify the fuel and dilution ratio. For information on fuel and dilution ratio, see upcoming publication. (WILL BE UPDATED AFTER SUBMISSION)

The images are saved as .jpg and the script is set to only use the red layer for the RGB image
